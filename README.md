these notes are by no means made by a professional, and they are for sure not complete. Do not try to solly learn CPP by using my noted because that is imposible. I took these notes to always have a refference if I ever needed one, and then decided to share these with the community. Some great free courses online that you can start with have been listed in this website -> https://www.onlinecoursereport.com/free/cplusplus/
 
 
 the course that I personally learned from was https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wd4AEIfdF5XR3QD/
        this was a great course, no regrets at all definitely recommend it
